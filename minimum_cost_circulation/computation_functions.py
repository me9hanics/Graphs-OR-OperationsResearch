"""
The algorithm of Goldberg and Tarjan (1989): 

1) G=(V,A,f,g,k). Set ‚àÄa‚ààA,g(a)=0 (demand). We set ‚àÄa‚ààA k(a) = -1 (cost) for all arcs to maximize volume with minimum cost.
    Set the circulation function x0 =0, and i = 0 (iteration).

2) Run a (strongly polynomial time) minimum-cost circulation algorithm on graph G, and find the minimum cost circulation for compressing.

3) Acquire the maximum volume circulation.


We split 2) into two steps: First step: Create the residual 
graph G_x_i = (V, A_x_i) from graph G and circulation x_i, and find a minimum mean cycle X^C in G_x_i.
(X^C is a cycle, the ^C is a superscript, not a power of C.)
Let -ùúÄ_i be the value of the mean. Second step: If -ùúÄ_i < 0 then set x_{i+1} = x_i + ùúèX^C,
where ùúè is the maximal possible amount to increase or decrease each flow in X^C (we add ùúè or take away ùúè
from each arc in X^C, based on if flow is sent on a forward or reverse arc in the residual graph),
we add 1 to i and we go back to the first step in 2). 
Else, we know our graph is minimal cost, and we go to 3).

    Compute the minimum mean cycle in a graph, assuming 0 demand.

    This is 2) in the Goldberg and Tarjan algorithm.

    Karp showed that finding a minimum mean cost cycle can be done in O(mn) time (on strongly connected graphs,
    otherwise run this on each component). His algorithm, published in 1972:
    Let 0‚â§k‚â§n,d_k(v) be the minimum distance walk ending in vertex v with k arcs.
    We define this function as so: ‚àÄv d_0(v)=0, d_(k+1)(v)=min{d_k(u)+c(a)|a=(u,v)‚ààA}, because
    the lowest distance k+1 arc walk to vertex v is a lowest distance walk with k arcs to some vertex u + the distance between u and v.

    Karp managed to prove that minimum mean of a directed cycle is equal to:

    min‚î¨(u‚ààV)max‚î¨(0‚â§k‚â§n-1)‚Å°„Äñ(d_n (u)-d_k (u))/(n-k)„Äó 
    
    Furthermore, a minimum mean cycle is contained in the path that set d_n (u).
    We will use this to find X^C in 2), the distance function is the cost function.
