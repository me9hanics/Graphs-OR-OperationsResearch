# Graphs-OR-Operations_Research
This is my (Mihaly Peter Hanics) repository to store implementations of algorithms and simulations in both Graph Theory and Operations Research.
Please, if you use my code, mention my name and work. If you use my work for a research paper, please refer to me, usually each project put up here will be closely connected with a research paper (as long as I find a journal that releases the paper).
