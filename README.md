# Graphs-OR-Operations_Research
This is a repository by Mihaly Peter *Hanics* to store implementations of algorithms, simulations and calculations, and analysis in the field of both Graph Theory and Operations Research.<br>
Please, if you use my code, refer to me; even better would be to cite a paper especially if you use my work for a research paper. The works put here are likely projects aim to be papers in journals such as CEJOR and graph theory, combinatorics ones.

### Portfolio compression modelled as minimum cost circulation
Mapping the most notable portfolio compression model, the conservative compression (as named by D'Errico and Roukny) to a lesser-known problem in graph theory: minimium cost circulation, particularly the maximum volume circulation (all costs equal to -1).<br>
This research was presented at the XXXV. Hungarian Operations Research Conference in Budapest in June 2023, and is submitted to the CEJOR journal. Thanks to Péter Biró and Tamás Fleiner for supervising this work as my BSc thesis.
